 * @defgroup PJSUA_DIALOG SIP Dialog
 * @ingroup PJSUA
 * @{
 * \brief
 *   This file contains SIP dialog, a higher level abstraction of SIP session.
 *
 * \par Overview
 * A SIP dialog is an abstraction of communication session between two user 
 * agents that persist for some time. The dialog facilitates sequencing of 
 * messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests between both
 * of them. The dialog represents a context in which to interpret SIP messages.
 * However method independent User Agent processing for requests and responses 
 * outside of a dialog exists, hence a dialog is not necessary for message 
 * processing.
 *
 * A dialog is identified at each User Agent with a dialog Id, which consists 
 * of a Call-Id value, a local tag and a remote tag. 
 *
 * A dialog contains certain pieces of data needed for further message 
 * transmissions within the dialog. This data consists of:
 *  - Dialog Id - used to identify the dialog.
 *  - Local sequence number - used to order requests from the UA to its peer.
 *  - Remote sequence number - used to order requests from its peer to the UA.
 *  - Local URI - the address of the local party.
 *  - Remote URI - the address of the remote party.
 *  - Remote target - the address from the Contact header field of the request 
 *    or response or refresh request or response.
 *  - "secure" boolean - determines if the dialog is secure.
 *  - Route set - an ordered list of URIs. The route set is the list of servers
 *    that need to be traversed to send a request to the peer. 
 *  - Authentication info - array of authentication credentials to be used
 *    by the dialog to authenticate to proxies and servers.
 *
 * \par Manipulating Dialog
 * Application should use functions declared in this file to do something with 
 * the dialog. Among other things, application can:
 *   - create outgoing dialog (#pjsip_dlg_init()).
 *   - sends outgoing invitation (#pjsip_dlg_invite()).
 *   - sends response (provisional and final) to incoming invitation
 *     (#pjsip_dlg_answer())
 *   - disconnect dialog (#pjsip_dlg_disconnect()).
 *   - send other request (#pjsip_dlg_create_request() and #pjsip_dlg_send_msg())
 *
 * \par Getting Dialog's Notification
 * Dialog emits notification about various things that's happening to it (e.g.
 * a message is received, dialog state has changed, etc.). Normally it is in
 * the interest of the application to capture these notifications, by
 * supplying the function to be called when the event occurs in #pjsip_dlg_callback
 * structure, and register this structure to user agent by calling 
 * #pjsip_ua_set_dialog_callback().
 *
 * \par Incoming Invitation
 * Upon receiving a new incoming invitation, user agent will automatically create
 * a new dialog, and inform application via \b pjsip_dlg_callback.
