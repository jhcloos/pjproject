 * @brief PJMEDIA object for sending/receiving media packets over the network
 * @{
 * The media transport (#pjmedia_transport) is the object to send and
 * receive media packets over the network. The media transport interface
 * allows the library to be extended to support different types of 
 * transports to send and receive packets. Currently only the standard
 * UDP transport implementation is provided (see \ref PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_UDP),
 * but application designer may extend the library to support other types
 * of custom transports such as RTP/RTCP over TCP, RTP/RTCP over HTTP, etc.
 *
 * The media transport is declared as #pjmedia_transport "class", which
 * declares "interfaces" to use the class in #pjmedia_transport_op
 * structure. For the user of the media transport (normally the user of
 * media transport is media stream, see \ref PJMED_STRM), these transport
 * "methods" are wrapped with API such as #pjmedia_transport_attach(),
 * so it should not need to call the function pointer inside 
 * #pjmedia_transport_op directly.
 *
 * \section PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_USING Using the Media Transport
 *
 * The media transport's life-cycle normally follows the following stages.
 *
 * \subsection PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_CREATE Creating the Media Transport
 *
 *  Application creates the media transport when it needs to establish
 *    media session to remote peer. The media transport is created using
 *    specific function to create that particular transport; for example,
 *    for UDP media transport, it is created with #pjmedia_transport_udp_create()
 *    or #pjmedia_transport_udp_create2() functions. Different media
 *    transports will provide different API to create those transports.
 *
 *  Alternatively, application may create pool of media transports when
 *    it is first started up. Using this approach probably is better, since
 *    application has to specify the RTP port when sending the initial
 *    session establishment request (e.g. SIP INVITE request), thus if
 *    application only creates the media transport later when media is to be
 *    established (normally when 200/OK is received, or when 18x is received
 *    for early media), there is a possibility that the particular RTP
 *    port might have been occupied by other programs. Also it is more
 *    efficient since sockets don't need to be closed and re-opened between
 *    calls.
 *
 *
 * \subsection PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_ATTACH Attaching and Using the Media Transport.
 *
 *  Application specifies the media transport instance when creating
 *    the media session (#pjmedia_session_create()). Alternatively, it
 *    may create the media stream directly with #pjmedia_stream_create()
 *    and specify the transport instance in the argument. (Note: media
 *    session is a high-level abstraction for media communications between
 *    two endpoints, and it may contain more than one media streams, for
 *    example, an audio stream and a video stream).
 *
 *  When stream is created, it will "attach" itself to the media 
 *    transport by calling #pjmedia_transport_attach(), which is a thin
 *    wrapper which calls "attach()" method of the media transport's 
 *    "virtual function pointer" (#pjmedia_transport_op). Among other things,
 *    the stream specifies two callback functions to the transport: one
 *    callback function will be called by transport when it receives RTP
 *    packet, and another callback for incoming RTCP packet. The 
 *    #pjmedia_transport_attach() function also establish the destination
 *    of the outgoing RTP and RTCP packets.
 *
 *  When the stream needs to send outgoing RTP/RTCP packets, it will
 *    call #pjmedia_transport_send_rtp() and #pjmedia_transport_send_rtcp()
 *    of the media transport API, which is a thin wrapper to call send_rtp() 
 *    and send_rtcp() methods in the media transport's "virtual function 
 *    pointer"  (#pjmedia_transport_op).
 *
 *  When the stream is destroyed, it will "detach" itself from
 *    the media transport by calling #pjmedia_transport_detach(), which is
 *    a thin wrapper which calls "detach()" method of the media transport's 
 *    "virtual function pointer" (#pjmedia_transport_op). After the transport
 *    is detached from its user (the stream), it will no longer report 
 *    incoming RTP/RTCP packets to the stream, and it will refuse to send
 *    outgoing packets since the destination has been cleared.
 *
 *
 * \subsection PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_REUSE Reusing the Media Transport.
 *
 *  After transport has been detached, application may re-attach the
 *    transport to another stream if it wants to. Detaching and re-attaching
 *    media transport may be preferable than closing and re-opening the
 *    transport, since it is more efficient (sockets don't need to be
 *    closed and re-opened). However it is up to the application to choose
 *    which method is most suitable for its uses.
 *
 * 
 * \subsection PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_DESTROY Destroying the Media Transport.
 *
 *  Finally if application no longer needs the media transport, it will
 *    call #pjmedia_transport_close() function, which is thin wrapper which 
 *    calls "destroy()" method of the media transport's  "virtual function 
 *    pointer" (#pjmedia_transport_op). This function releases
 *    all resources used by the transport, such as sockets and memory.
 *
 *
 * \section PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_H_IMPL Implementing Media Transport
 *
 * To implement a new type of media transport, one needs to "subclass" the
 * media transport "class" (#pjmedia_transport) by providing the "methods"
 * in the media transport "interface" (#pjmedia_transport_op), and provides
 * a function to create this new type of transport (similar to 
 * #pjmedia_transport_udp_create() function).
 *
 * The media transport is expected to run indepently, that is there should
 * be no polling like function to poll the transport for incoming RTP/RTCP
 * packets. This normally can be done by registering the media sockets to
 * the media endpoint's IOQueue, which allows the transport to be notified
 * when incoming packet has arrived.
 *
 * Alternatively, media transport may utilize thread(s) internally to wait
 * for incoming packets. The thread then will call the appropriate RTP or
 * RTCP callback provided by its user (stream) whenever packet is received.
 * If the transport's user is a stream, then the callbacks provided by the
 * stream will be thread-safe, so the transport may call these callbacks
 * without having to serialize the access with some mutex protection. But
 * the media transport may still have to protect its internal data with
 * mutex protection, since it may be called by application's thread (for
 * example, to send RTP/RTCP packets).
 *
 * For an example of media transport implementation, please refer to 
 * <tt>transport_udp.h</tt> and <tt>transport_udp.c</tt> in PJMEDIA source
 * distribution.
