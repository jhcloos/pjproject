 * to peer via a TURN relay. The application establishes TURN connection to
 * the TURN server using UDP or TCP as the transport, then creates a relay
 * address in the TURN server to be advertised to remote peer(s) as the 
 * transport address. When application sends data to a remote address via
 * this transport, the data will be sent via the TURN relay, and vice versa.
