/**
 * @defgroup PJNATH_ICE_STREAM_TRANSPORT ICE Stream Transport
 * @brief Transport for media stream using ICE
 * @ingroup PJNATH_ICE
 * @{
 *
 * This module describes ICE stream transport, as represented by #pj_ice_st
 * structure, and is part of PJNATH - the Open Source NAT traversal helper
 * library.
 *
 * ICE stream transport, as represented by #pj_ice_st structure, is an ICE
 * capable component for transporting media within a media stream. 
 * It consists of one or more transport sockets (typically two for RTP
 * based communication - one for RTP and one for RTCP), and an 
 * \ref PJNATH_ICE_SESSION for performing connectivity checks among the.
 * various candidates of the transport addresses.
 *
 * \section PJNATH_ICE_STREAM_TRANSPORT_USING Using the ICE Stream Transport
 *
 * Application may use the ICE stream transport in two ways:
 *  - it can create the ICE stream transports once during application 
 *    initialization and keep them alive throughout application lifetime, or
 *  - it can create and destroy the ICE stream transport as needed everytime 
 *     a call is made and destroyed. 
 *
 * Keeping the ICE stream transport alive throughout
 * application's lifetime is normally preferable, as initializing the
 * ICE stream transport may incur delay because the ICE stream transport
 * would need to communicate with the STUN/TURN server to get the
 * server reflexive and relayed candidates for the transports.
 *
 * Regardless of which usage scenario is being used, the ICE stream
 * transport is capable for restarting the ICE session being used and to
 * send STUN keep-alives for its STUN server reflexive and relayed
 * candidates.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_INIT Stream Transport Initialization
 *
 * Application creates the ICE stream transport by calling 
 * #pj_ice_st_create() function.
 *
 * After the ICE stream transport is created, application may set up the
 * STUN servers to be used to obtain STUN server reflexive and relayed
 * candidate, by calling #pj_ice_st_set_stun_domain() or 
 * #pj_ice_st_set_stun_srv(). Then it has to create each component by
 * calling #pj_ice_st_create_comp(); this would create an actual socket
 * which listens to the specified local address, and it would also
 * perform lookup to find various transport address candidates for this
 * socket.
 * 
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_INIT_ICE ICE Session Initialization
 *
 * When application is about to send an offer containing ICE capability,
 * or when it receives an offer containing ICE capability, it would
 * create the ICE session by calling #pj_ice_st_init_ice(). This would
 * register all transport address aliases for each component to the ICE
 * session as candidates. After this application can enumerate all local
 * candidates by calling #pj_ice_st_enum_cands(), and encode these
 * candidates in the SDP to be sent to remote agent.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_START Starting Connectivity Checks
 *
 * Once application receives the SDP from remote, it can start ICE
 * connectivity checks by calling #pj_ice_st_start_ice(), specifying
 * the username, password, and candidates of the remote agent. The ICE
 * session/transport will then notify the application via the callback
 * when ICE connectivity checks completes, either successfully or with
 * failure.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_STOP Stopping ICE Session
 *
 * Once the call is terminated, application no longer needs to keep the
 * ICE session, so it should call #pj_ice_st_stop_ice() to destroy the
 * ICE session within this ICE stream transport. Note that this WILL NOT
 * destroy the sockets/transports, it only destroys the ICE session
 * within this ICE stream transport.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_RESTART Restarting ICE Session
 *
 * When a new call is made, application can repeat the above
 * #pj_ice_st_init_ice() to #pj_ice_st_stop_ice() cycle for the new call,
 * using this same ICE stream transport.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ST_TRA_DESTROY Destroying ICE Stream Transport
 *
 * Finally, when the ICE stream transport itself is no longer needed,
 * for example when the application quits, application should call
 * #pj_ice_st_destroy() to release back all resources allocated by this
 * ICE stream transport.
