-= INTRO=-

This top level projects:

 - pjlib:       portability and basic framework library
 - pjlib-util:  lexical scanner, XML, STUN, MD5, etc.
 - pjmedia:     media framework and codecs
 - pjsip:       SIP stacks (core, UA layer, SIMPLE, etc.)
 - pjsip-apps:  SIP apps (pjsua, pjsip-perf)


-= OBJECTIVE =-

Currently we only have two working applications:

 - pjsua:       Console based SIP UA
 - pjsip-perf:  SIP performance measurement


-= COMPILING =-

On Windows:
 - Open pjsip-apps/build/pjsip_apps.dsw
 - Build pjsua and pjsip_perf project

With Makefile:
 - on top level dir (e.g. ~/pjproject)
 - ./configure && make dep && make clean && make

Binaries will be in pjsip-apps/bin.


-= PORTING =-

 - Just need to port pjlib.
 - PJLIB doc has detailed info how to do this.
 - Must pass pjlib-test!
