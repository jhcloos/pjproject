\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction to Speex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Speex project (
\family typewriter
http://www.speex.org/
\family default
) has been started because there was a need for a speech codec that was
 open-source and free from software patents.
 These are essential conditions for being used by any open-source software.
 There is already Vorbis that does general audio, but it is not really suitable
 for speech.
 Also, unlike many other speech codecs, Speex is not targeted at cell phones
 but rather at voice over IP (VoIP) and file-based compression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As design goals, we wanted to have a codec that would allow both very good
 quality speech and low bit-rate (unfortunately not at the same time!),
 which led us to developing a codec with multiple bit-rates.
 Of course very good quality also meant we had to do wideband (16 kHz sampling
 rate) in addition to narrowband (telephone quality, 8 kHz sampling rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Designing for VoIP instead of cell phone use means that Speex must be robust
 to lost packets, but not to corrupted ones since packets either arrive
 unaltered or don't arrive at all.
 Also, the idea was to have a reasonable complexity and memory requirement
 without compromising too much on the efficiency of the codec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this led us to the choice of CELP
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{CELP}

\end_inset

 as the encoding technique to use for Speex.
 One of the main reasons is that CELP has long proved that it could do the
 job and scale well to both low bit-rates (think DoD CELP @ 4.8 kbps) and
 high bit-rates (think G.728 @ 16 kbps).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is divided in the following way.
 Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Feature-description}

\end_inset

 describes the different Speex features and defines some terms that will
 be used in later sections.
 Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Command-line-encoder/decoder}

\end_inset

 provides information about the standard command-line tools, while 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Programming-with-Speex}

\end_inset

 contains information about programming using the Speex API.
 Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Formats-and-standards}

\end_inset

 has some information related to Speex and standards.
 The three last sections describe the internals of the codec and require
 some signal processing knowledge.
 Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Introduction-to-CELP}

\end_inset

 explains the general idea behind CELP, while sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-wideband-mode}

\end_inset

 are specific to Speex.
 Note that if you are only interested in using Speex, those three last sections
 are not required.

Codec description
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Feature-description}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the main features provided by Speex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before introducing all the Speex features, here are some concepts in speech
 coding that help better understand the rest of the manual.
 Emphasis is placed on Speex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Sampling rate
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{sampling rate}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speex is mainly designed for three different sampling rates: 8 kHz, 16 kHz,
 and 32 kHz.
 These are respectively refered to as narrowband
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{narrowband}

\end_inset

, wideband
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{wideband}

\end_inset

 and ultra-wideband
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{ultra-wideband}

\end_inset

.
 For a sampling rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}$
\end_inset

 kHz, the highest frequency that can be represented is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}/2$
\end_inset

 kHz.
 This is a consequence of Nyquist's sampling theorem (and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}/2$
\end_inset

 is known as the Nyquist frequency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Quality
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{quality}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speex encoding is controlled most of the time by a quality parameter that
 ranges from 0 to 10.
 In constant bit-rate
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{constant bit-rate}

\end_inset

 (CBR) operation, the quality parameter is an integer, while for variable
 bit-rate (VBR), the parameter is a float.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Complexity
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{complexity}

\end_inset

 (variable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Speex, it is possible to vary the complexity allowed for the encoder.
 This is done by controlling how the search is performed with an integer
 ranging from 1 to 10 in a way that's similar to the -1 to -9 options to
 
\emph on
gzip
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
bzip2
\emph default
 compression utilities.
 For normal use, the noise level at complexity 1 is between 1 and 2 dB higher
 than at complexity 10, but the CPU requirements for complexity 10 is about
 5 times higher than for complexity 1.
 In practice, the best trade-off is between complexity 2 and 4, though higher
 settings are often useful when encoding non-speech sounds like DTMF
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{DTMF}

\end_inset

 tones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Variable Bit-Rate
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{variable bit-rate}

\end_inset

 (VBR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variable bit-rate (VBR) allows a codec to change its bit-rate dynamically
 to adapt to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficulty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the audio being encoded.
 In the example of Speex, sounds like vowels and high-energy transients
 require a higher bit-rate to achieve good quality, while fricatives (e.g.
 s,f sounds) can be coded adequately with less bits.
 For this reason, VBR can achive lower bit-rate for the same quality, or
 a better quality for a certain bit-rate.
 Despite its advantages, VBR has two main drawbacks: first, by only specifying
 quality, there's no guaranty about the final average bit-rate.
 Second, for some real-time applications like voice over IP (VoIP), what
 counts is the maximum bit-rate, which must be low enough for the communication
 channel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Average Bit-Rate
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{average bit-rate}

\end_inset

 (ABR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average bit-rate solves one of the problems of VBR, as it dynamically adjusts
 VBR quality in order to meet a specific target bit-rate.
 Because the quality/bit-rate is adjusted in real-time (open-loop), the
 global quality will be slightly lower than that obtained by encoding in
 VBR with exactly the right quality setting to meet the target average bit-rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Voice Activity Detection
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{voice activity detection}

\end_inset

 (VAD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When enabled, voice activity detection detects whether the audio being encoded
 is speech or silence/background noise.
 VAD is always implicitly activated when encoding in VBR, so the option
 is only useful in non-VBR operation.
 In this case, Speex detects non-speech periods and encode them with just
 enough bits to reproduce the background noise.
 This is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

comfort noise generation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (CNG).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Discontinuous Transmission
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{discontinuous transmission}

\end_inset

 (DTX)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discontinuous transmission is an addition to VAD/VBR operation, that allows
 to stop transmitting completely when the background noise is stationary.
 In file-based operation, since we cannot just stop writing to the file,
 only 5 bits are used for such frames (corresponding to 250 bps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Perceptual enhancement
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{perceptual enhancement}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when turned on, tries
 to reduce (the perception of) the noise produced by the coding/decoding
 process.
 In most cases, perceptual enhancement make the sound further from the original
 
\emph on
objectively
\emph default
 (if you use SNR), but in the end it still 
\emph on
sounds
\emph default
 better (subjective improvement).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Algorithmic delay
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{algorithmic delay}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every speech codec introduces a delay in the transmission.
 For Speex, this delay is equal to the frame size, plus some amount of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look-ahead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 required to process each frame.
 In narrowband operation (8 kHz), the delay is 30 ms, while for wideband
 (16 kHz), the delay is 34 ms.
 These values don't account for the CPU time it takes to encode or decode
 the frames.

\begin_layout Section
Preprocessor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part refers to the preprocessor module introduced in the 1.1.x branch.
 The preprocessor is designed to be used on the audio 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 running the encoder.
 The preprocessor provides three main functionalities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
noise suppression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
automatic gain control (AGC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
voice activity detection (VAD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The denoiser can be used to reduce the amount of background noise present
 in the input signal.
 This provides higher quality speech whether or not the denoised signal
 is encoded with Speex (or at all).
 However, when using the denoised signal with the codec, there is an additional
 benefit.
 Speech codecs in general (Speex included) tend to perform poorly on noisy
 input, which tends to amplify the noise.
 The denoiser greatly reduces this effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatic gain control (AGC) is a feature that deals with the fact that
 the recording volume may vary by a large amount between different setups.
 The AGC provides a way to adjust a signal to a reference volume.
 This is useful for voice over IP because it removes the need for manual
 adjustment of the microphone gain.
 A secondary advantage is that by setting the microphone gain to a conservative
 (low) level, it is easier to avoid clipping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The voice activity detector (VAD) provided by the preprocessor is more advanced
 than the one directly provided in the codec.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Adaptive Jitter Buffer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When transmitting voice (or any content for that matter) over UDP or RTP,
 packet may be lost, arrive with different delay, or even out of order.
 The purpose of a jitter buffer is to reorder packets and buffer them long
 enough (but no longer than necessary) so they can be sent to be decoded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Acoustic Echo Canceller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any hands-free communication system (Fig.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:Acoustic-echo-model}

\end_inset

), speech from the remote end is played in the local loudspeaker, propagates
 in the room and is captured by the microphone.
 If the audio captured from the microphone is sent directly to the remote
 end, then the remove user hears an echo of his voice.
 An acoustic echo canceller is designed to remove the acoustic echo before
 it is sent to the remote end.
 It is important to understand that the echo canceller is meant to improve
 the quality on the

 end.

\begin_layout Section
Encoding
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Encoding}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to encode speech using Speex, you first need to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <speex/speex.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You then need to declare a Speex bit-packing struct
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SpeexBits bits;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and a Speex encoder state
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
void *enc_state;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two are initialized by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_init(&bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
enc_state = speex_encoder_init(&speex_nb_mode);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For wideband coding, 
\emph on
speex_nb_mode
\emph default
 will be replaced by 
\emph on
speex_wb_mode
\emph default
.
 In most cases, you will need to know the frame size used by the mode you
 are using.
 You can get that value in the 
\emph on
frame_size
\emph default
 variable with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_encoder_ctl(enc_state,SPEEX_GET_FRAME_SIZE,&frame_size);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, 
\emph on
frame_size
\emph default
 will correspond to 20 ms when using 8, 16, or 32 kHz sampling rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the initialization is done, for every input frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_reset(&bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_encode_int(enc_state, input_frame, &bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nbBytes = speex_bits_write(&bits, byte_ptr, MAX_NB_BYTES);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
input_frame
\emph default
 is a 
\emph on
(
\emph default
short
\emph on
 *)
\emph default
 pointing to the beginning of a speech frame, 
\emph on
byte_ptr
\emph default
 is a 
\emph on
(char *)
\emph default
 where the encoded frame will be written, 
\emph on
MAX_NB_BYTES
\emph default
 is the maximum number of bytes that can be written to 
\emph on
byte_ptr
\emph default
 without causing an overflow and 
\emph on
nbBytes
\emph default
 is the number of bytes actually written to 
\emph on
byte_ptr
\emph default
 (the encoded size in bytes).
 Before calling speex_bits_write, it is possible to find the number of bytes
 that need to be written by calling 
\family typewriter
speex_bits_nbytes(&bits)
\family default
, which returns a number of bytes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is still possible to use the 
\emph on
speex_encode()
\emph default
 function, which takes a 
\emph on
(float *)
\emph default
 for the audio.
 However, this would make an eventual port to an FPU-less platform (like
 ARM) more complicated.
 Internally, 
\emph on
speex_encode() 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 speex_encode_int()
\emph default
 are processed in the same way.
 Whether the encoder uses the fixed-point version is only decided by the
 compile-time flags, not at the API level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you're done with the encoding, free all resources with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_encoder_destroy(enc_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's about it for the encoder.

\begin_layout Section
Decoding
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Decoding}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to decode speech using Speex, you first need to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <speex/speex.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You also need to declare a Speex bit-packing struct
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SpeexBits bits;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and a Speex decoder state
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
void *dec_state;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two are initialized by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_init(&bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dec_state = speex_decoder_init(&speex_nb_mode);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For wideband decoding, 
\emph on
speex_nb_mode
\emph default
 will be replaced by 
\emph on
speex_wb_mode
\emph default
.
 If you need to obtain the size of the frames that will be used by the decoder,
 you can get that value in the 
\emph on
frame_size
\emph default
 variable with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_decoder_ctl(dec_state, SPEEX_GET_FRAME_SIZE, &frame_size); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a parameter that can be set for the decoder: whether or not
 to use a perceptual enhancer.
 This can be set by: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_decoder_ctl(dec_state, SPEEX_SET_ENH, &enh); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
enh
\emph default
 is an int with value 0 to have the enhancer disabled and 1 to have it enabled.
 As of 1.2-beta1, the default is now to enable the enhancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, once the decoder initialization is done, for every input frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_read_from(&bits, input_bytes, nbBytes);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_decode_int(dec_state, &bits, output_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where input_bytes is a 
\emph on
(char *)
\emph default
 containing the bit-stream data received for a frame, 
\emph on
nbBytes
\emph default
 is the size (in bytes) of that bit-stream, and 
\emph on
output_frame
\emph default
 is a 
\emph on
(short *)
\emph default
 and points to the area where the decoded speech frame will be written.
 A NULL value as the first argument indicates that we don't have the bits
 for the current frame.
 When a frame is lost, the Speex decoder will do its best to "guess" the
 correct signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the encoder, the 
\emph on
speex_decode()
\emph default
 function can still be used, with a 
\emph on
(float *)
\emph default
 as the output for the audio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you're done with the decoding, free all resources with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_decoder_destroy(dec_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Preprocessor
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Preprocessor}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the Speex preprocessor
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{preprocessor}

\end_inset

, you first need to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <speex/speex_preprocess.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, a preprocessor state can be created as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SpeexPreprocessState *preprocess_state = speex_preprocess_state_init(frame_size,
 sampling_rate);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended to use the same value for 
\family typewriter
frame_size
\family default
 as is used by the encoder (20 
\emph on
ms
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each input frame, you need to call:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_preprocess_run(preprocess_state, audio_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\family typewriter
audio_frame
\family default
 is used both as input and output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where the output audio is not useful for a certain frame, it is
 possible to use instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_preprocess_estimate_update(preprocess_state, audio_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This call will update all the preprocessor internal state variables without
 computing the output audio, thus saving some CPU cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The behaviour of the preprocessor can be changed using:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_preprocess_ctl(preprocess_state, request, ptr);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which is used in the same way as the encoder and decoder equivalent.
 Options are listed in Section .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preprocessor state can be destroyed using:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_preprocess_state_destroy(preprocess_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Echo Cancellation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Echo-Cancellation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Speex library now includes an echo cancellation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{echo cancellation}

\end_inset

 algorithm suitable for Acoustic Echo Cancellation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{acoustic echo cancellation}

\end_inset

 (AEC).
 In order to use the echo canceller, you first need to
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <speex/speex_echo.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, an echo canceller state can be created by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SpeexEchoState *echo_state = speex_echo_state_init(frame_size, filter_length);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\family typewriter
frame_size
\family default
 is the amount of data (in samples) you want to process at once and 
\family typewriter
filter_length
\family default
 is the length (in samples) of the echo cancelling filter you want to use
 (also known as 
\shape italic
tail length
\shape default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{tail length}

\end_inset

).
 It is recommended to use a frame size in the order of 20 ms (or equal to
 the codec frame size) and make sure it is easy to perform an FFT of that
 size (powers of two are better than prime sizes).
 The recommended tail length is approximately the third of the room reverberatio
n time.
 For example, in a small room, reverberation time is in the order of 300
 ms, so a tail length of 100 ms is a good choice (800 samples at 8000 Hz
 sampling rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the echo canceller state is created, audio can be processed by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_cancellation(echo_state, input_frame, echo_frame, output_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\family typewriter
input_frame
\family default
 is the audio as captured by the microphone, 
\family typewriter
echo_frame
\family default
 is the signal that was played in the speaker (and needs to be removed)
 and 
\family typewriter
output_frame
\family default
 is the signal with echo removed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important thing to keep in mind is the relationship between 
\family typewriter
input_frame
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
echo_frame
\family default
.
 It is important that, at any time, any echo that is present in the input
 has already been sent to the echo canceller as 
\family typewriter
echo_frame
\family default
.
 In other words, the echo canceller cannot remove a signal that it hasn't
 yet received.
 On the other hand, the delay between the input signal and the echo signal
 must be small enough because otherwise part of the echo cancellation filter
 is inefficient.
 In the ideal case, you code would look like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
write_to_soundcard(echo_frame, frame_size);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
read_from_soundcard(input_frame, frame_size);
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_cancellation(echo_state, input_frame, echo_frame, output_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to further reduce the echo present in the signal, you can do
 so by 
\family typewriter
associating the echo canceller to the preprocessor
\family default
 (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Preprocessor}

\end_inset

).
 This is done by calling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_preprocess_ctl(preprocess_state, SPEEX_PREPROCESS_SET_ECHO_STATE,
 echo_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the initialisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 1.2-beta2, there is an alternative, simpler API that can be
 used instead of 
\emph on
speex_echo_cancellation()
\emph default
.
 When audio capture and playback are handled asynchronously (e.g.
 in different threads or using the 
\emph on
poll()
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
select()
\emph default
 system call), it can be difficult to keep track of what input_frame comes
 with what echo_frame.
 Instead, the playback comtext/thread can simply call:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_playback(echo_state, echo_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
every time an audio frame is played.
 Then, the capture context/thread calls:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_capture(echo_state, input_frame, output_frame);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for every frame captured.
 Internally, 
\emph on
speex_echo_playback()
\emph default
 simply buffers the playback frame so it can be used by 
\emph on
speex_echo_capture()
\emph default
 to call 
\emph on
speex_echo_cancel()
\emph default
.
 A side effect of using this alternate API is that the playback audio is
 delayed by two frames, which is the normal delay caused by the soundcard.
 When capture and playback are already synchronised, 
\emph on
speex_echo_cancellation()
\emph default
 is preferable since it gives better control on the exact input/echo timing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The echo cancellation state can be destroyed with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_state_destroy(echo_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to reset the state of the echo canceller so it can be
 reused without the need to create another state with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
speex_echo_state_reset(echo_state);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Troubleshooting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several things that may prevent the echo canceller from working
 properly.
 One of them is a bug (or something suboptimal) in the code, but there are
 many others you should consider first
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using a different soundcard to do the capture and plaback will *not* work,
 regardless of what you may think.
 The only exception to that is if the two cards can be made to have their
 sampling clock 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locked
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the same clock source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The delay between the record and playback signals must be minimal.
 Any signal played has to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the playback (far end) signal slightly before the echo canceller 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sees
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it in the near end signal, but excessive delay means that part of the filter
 length is wasted.
 In the worst situations, the delay is such that it is longer than the filter
 length, in which case, no echo can be cancelled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When it comes to echo tail length (filter length), longer is *not* better.
 Actually, the longer the tail length, the longer it takes for the filter
 to adapt.
 Of course, a tail length that is too short will not cancel enough echo,
 but the most common problem seen is that people set a very long tail length
 and then wonder why no echo is being cancelled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Non-linear distortion cannot (by definition) be modeled by the linear adaptive
 filter used in the echo canceller and thus cannot be cancelled.
 Use good audio gear and avoid saturation/clipping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_inset

, which explains the fundamental principles of echo cancellation.
 The details of the algorithm described in the article are different, but
 the general ideas of echo cancellation through adaptive filters are the
 same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 1.2beta2, a new 
\family typewriter
echo_diagnostic.m
\family default
 tool is included in the source distribution.
 The first step is to define DUMP_ECHO_CANCEL_DATA during the build.
 This causes the echo canceller to automatically save the near-end, far-end
 and output signals to files (aec_rec.sw aec_play.sw and aec_out.sw).
 These are exactly what the AEC receives and outputs.
 From there, it is necessary to start Octave and type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo_diagnostic('aec_rec.sw', 'aec_play.sw', 'aec_diagnostic.sw', 1024);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of 1024 is the filter length and can be changed.
 There will be some (hopefully) useful messages printed and echo cancelled
 audio will be saved to aec_diagnostic.sw .
 If even that output is bad (almost no cancellation) then there is  probably
 problem with the playback or recording process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Jitter Buffer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two jitter buffers.
 Both can be enabled by including:

\begin_layout Section
Resampler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 1.2beta2, Speex includes a resampling modules.
 To make use of the resampler, it is necessary to include its header file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <speex/speex_resampler.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each stream that is to be resampled, it is necessary to create a resampler
 state with:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SpeexResamplerState *resampler;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
resampler = speex_resampler_init(nb_channels, input_rate, output_rate, quality);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where nb_channels is the number of channels that will be used (either interleave
d or non-interleaved), input_rate is the sampling rate of the input stream,
 output_rate is the sampling rate of the output stream and quality is the
 requested quality setting (0 to 10).
 The quality parameter is useful for controlling the quality/complexity/latency
 tradeoff.
 Using a higher quality setting means less noise/aliasing, a higher complexity
 and a higher latency.
 Usually, a quality of 3 is acceptable for most desktop uses and quality
 10 is mostly recommended for pro audio work.
 Quality 0 usually has a decent sound (certainly better than using linear
 interpolation resampling), but artifacts may be heard.

Packing and in-band signalling
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{in-band signalling}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes it is desirable to pack more than one frame per packet (or other
 basic unit of storage).
 The proper way to do it is to call speex_encode 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times before writing the stream with speex_bits_write.
 In cases where the number of frames is not determined by an out-of-band
 mechanism, it is possible to include a terminator code.
 That terminator consists of the code 15 (decimal) encoded with 5 bits,
 as shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:quality_vs_bps}

\end_inset

.
 Note that as of version 1.0.2, calling speex_bits_write automatically inserts
 the terminator so as to fill the last byte.
 This doesn't involves any overhead and makes sure Speex can always detect
 when there is no more frame in a packet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to send in-band 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

messages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the other side.
 All these messages are encoded as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pseudo-frames
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of mode 14 which contain a 4-bit message type code, followed by the message.
 Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:In-band-signalling-codes}

\end_inset

 lists the available codes, their meaning and the size of the message that
 follows.
 Most of these messages are requests that are sent to the encoder or decoder
 on the other end, which is free to comply or ignore them.
 By default, all in-band messages are ignored.

Finally, applications may define custom in-band messages using mode 13.
 The size of the message in bytes is encoded with 5 bits, so that the decoder

\begin_layout Standard
Speex can encode speech in both narrowband and wideband and provides different
 bit-rates.
 However, not all features need to be supported by a certain implementation
 or device.
 In order to be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Speex compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (whatever that means), an implementation must implement at least a basic
 set of features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the minimum, all narrowband modes of operation MUST be supported at the
 decoder.
 This includes the decoding of a wideband bit-stream by the narrowband decoder
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
The wideband bit-stream contains an embedded narrowband bit-stream which
 can be decoded alone
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If present, a wideband decoder MUST be able to decode a narrowband stream,
 and MAY either be able to decode all wideband modes or be able to decode
 the embedded narrowband part of all modes (which includes ignoring the
 high-band bits).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For encoders, at least one narrowband or wideband mode MUST be supported.
 The main reason why all encoding modes do not have to be supported is that
 some platforms may not be able to handle the complexity of encoding in
 some modes.

\begin_layout Standard
Speex bit-streams can be stored in Ogg files.
 In this case, the first packet of the Ogg file contains the Speex header
 described in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:ogg_speex_header}

\end_inset

 The next field, 
\family typewriter

\family default
 contains the version of Speex that encoded the file.
 For now, refer to speex_header.[ch] for more info.
 The 
\emph on

\emph default
 (
\family typewriter

\family default
) flag is set to 1 for the header.
 The header packet has 
\family typewriter
packetno=0
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
granulepos=0
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second packet contains the Speex comment header.
 The format used is the Vorbis comment format described here: http://www.xiph.org/

 This packet has 
\family typewriter
packetno=1

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third and subsequent packets each contain one or more (number found
 in header) Speex frames.
 These are identified with 
\family typewriter
packetno

Speex is based on CELP, which stands for Code Excited Linear Prediction.
 This section attempts to introduce the principles behind CELP, so if you
 are already familiar with CELP, you can safely skip to section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset

.
 The CELP technique is based on three ideas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The use of a linear prediction (LP) model to model the vocal tract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The use of (adaptive and fixed) codebook entries as input (excitation) of
 the LP model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the basic ideas behind CELP.
 This is still a work in progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Source-Filter Model of Speech Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source-filter model of speech production assumes that the vocal cords
 are the source of spectrally flat sound (the excitation signal), and that
 the vocal tract acts as a filter to spectrally shape the various sounds
 of speech.
 While still an approximation, the model is widely used in speech coding
 because of its simplicity.Its use is also the reason why most speech codecs
 (Speex included) perform badly on music signals.
 The different phonemes can be distinguished by their excitation (source)
 and spectral shape (filter).
 Voiced sounds (e.g.
 vowels) have an excitation signal that is periodic and that can be approximated
 by an impulse train in the time domain or by regularly-spaced harmonics
 in the frequency domain.
 On the other hand, fricatives (such as the "s", "sh" and "f" sounds) have
 an excitation signal that is similar to white Gaussian noise.
 So called voice fricatives (such as "z" and "v") have excitation signal
 composed of an harmonic part and a noisy part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source-filter model is usually tied with the use of Linear prediction.
 The CELP model is based on source-filter model, as can be seen from the
 CELP decoder illustrated in Figure

Linear Prediction (LPC)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{linear prediction}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear prediction is at the base of many speech coding techniques, including
 CELP.
 The idea behind it is to predict the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 using a linear combination of its past samples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
y[n]=\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x[n-i]\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y[n]$
\end_inset

 is the linear prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

.
 The prediction error is thus given by:
\begin_inset Formula \[
e[n]=x[n]-y[n]=x[n]-\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x[n-i]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the LPC analysis is to find the best prediction coefficients
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 which minimize the quadratic error function:
\begin_inset Formula \[
E=\sum_{n=0}^{L-1}\left[e[n]\right]^{2}=\sum_{n=0}^{L-1}\left[x[n]-\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x[n-i]\right]^{2}\]

\end_inset

That can be done by making all derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial E}{\partial a_{i}}$
\end_inset

 equal to zero:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a_{i}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial a_{i}}\sum_{n=0}^{L-1}\left[x[n]-\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x[n-i]\right]^{2}=0\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an order 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 filter, the filter coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 are found by solving the system 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 linear system 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Ra}=\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{R}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
R(0) & R(1) & \cdots & R(N-1)\\
R(1) & R(0) & \cdots & R(N-2)\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
R(N-1) & R(N-2) & \cdots & R(0)\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{r}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
R(1)\\
R(2)\\
\vdots\\
R(N)\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $R(m)$
\end_inset

, the auto-correlation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{auto-correlation}

\end_inset

 of the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

, computed as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
R(m)=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[i]x[i-m]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is toeplitz hermitian, the Levinson-Durbin
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Levinson-Durbin}

\end_inset

 algorithm can be used, making the solution to the problem 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Also, it can be proven that all the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset

 are within the unit circle, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A(z)$
\end_inset

 is always stable.
 This is in theory; in practice because of finite precision, there are two
 commonly used techniques to make sure we have a stable filter.
 First, we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $R(0)$
\end_inset

 by a number slightly above one (such as 1.0001), which is equivalent to
 adding noise to the signal.
 Also, we can apply a window to the auto-correlation, which is equivalent
 to filtering in the frequency domain, reducing sharp resonances.

\begin_layout Section
Pitch Prediction
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{pitch}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During voiced segments, the speech signal is periodic, so it is possible
 to take advantage of that property by approximating the excitation signal
 
\begin_inset Formula $e[n]$
\end_inset

 by a gain times the past of the excitation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
e[n]\simeq p[n]=\beta e[n-T]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the pitch period, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the pitch gain.
 We call that long-term prediction since the excitation is predicted from
 
\begin_inset Formula $e[n-T]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T\gg N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

Noise Weighting
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{error weighting}

\end_inset


\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{analysis-by-synthesis}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most (if not all) modern audio codecs attempt to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the noise so that it appears mostly in the frequency regions where the
 ear cannot detect it.
 For example, the ear is more tolerant to noise in parts of the spectrum
 that are louder and 
\emph on
vice versa
\emph default
.
 In order to maximize speech quality, CELP codecs minimize the mean square
 of the error (noise) in the perceptually weighted domain.
 This means that a perceptual noise weighting filter 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset

 is applied to the error signal in the encoder.
 In most CELP codecs, 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset

 is a pole-zero weighting filter derived from the linear prediction coefficients
 (LPC), generally using bandwidth expansion.
 Let the spectral envelope be represented by the synthesis filter 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A(z)$
\end_inset

, CELP codecs typically derive the noise weighting filter as: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
W(z)=\frac{A(z/\gamma_{1})}{A(z/\gamma_{2})}\label{eq:gamma-weighting}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}=0.9$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}=0.6$
\end_inset

 in the Speex reference implementation.
 If a filter 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset

 has (complex) poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-plane, the filter 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z/\gamma)$
\end_inset

 will have its poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $p'_{i}=\gamma p_{i}$
\end_inset

, making it a flatter version of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weighting filter is applied to the error signal used to optimize the
 codebook search through analysis-by-synthesis (AbS).
 This results in a spectral shape of the noise that tends towards 
\begin_inset Formula $1/W(z)$
\end_inset

.
 While the simplicity of the model has been an important reason for the
 success of CELP, it remains that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset

 is a very rough approximation for the perceptually optimal noise weighting
 function.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Standard-noise-shaping}

\end_inset

 illustrates the noise shaping that results from Eq.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:gamma-weighting}

\end_inset

.
 Throughout this paper, we refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset

 as the noise weighting filter and to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/W(z)$
\end_inset

 as the noise shaping filter (or curve).

\begin_layout Section
Analysis-by-Synthesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main principles behind CELP is called Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS),
 meaning that the encoding (analysis) is performed by perceptually optimising
 the decoded (synthesis) signal in a closed loop.
 In theory, the best CELP stream would be produced by trying all possible
 bit combinations and selecting the one that produces the best-sounding
 decoded signal.
 This is obviously not possible in practice for two reasons: the required
 complexity is beyond any currently available hardware and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best sounding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 selection criterion implies a human listener.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to achieve real-time encoding using limited computing resources,
 the CELP optimisation is broken down into smaller, more manageable, sequential
 searches using the perceptual weighting function described earlier.

This section looks at how Speex works for narrowband (
\begin_inset Formula $8\:\mathrm{kHz}$

 sampling rate) operation.
 The frame size for this mode is 
\begin_inset Formula $20\:\mathrm{ms}$
\end_inset

, corresponding to 160 samples.
 Each frame is also subdivided into 4 sub-frames of 40 samples each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also many design decisions were based on the original goals and assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 to packet loss)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Whole-Frame Analysis
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{linear prediction}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In narrowband, Speex frames are 20 ms long (160 samples) and are subdivided
 in 4 sub-frames of 5 ms each (40 samples).
 For most narrowband bit-rates (8 kbps and above), the only parameters encoded
 at the frame level are the Line Spectral Pairs (LSP) and a global excitation
 gain 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{frame}$
\end_inset

, as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Frame-open-loop-analysis}

\end_inset

.
 All other parameters are encoded at the sub-frame level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear prediction analysis is performed once per frame using an asymmetric
 Hamming window centered on the fourth sub-frame.
 Because linear prediction coefficients (LPC) are not robust to quantization,
 they are first are converted to line spectral pairs (LSP)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{line spectral pair}

\end_inset

.
 The LSP's are considered to be associated to the 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{th}$
\end_inset

 sub-frames and the LSP's associated to the first 3 sub-frames are linearly
 interpolated using the current and previous LSP coefficients.
 The LSP coefficients and converted back to the LPC filter 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 The non-quantized interpolated filter is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset

 and can be used for the weighting filter 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset

 because it does not need to be available to the decoder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make Speex more robust to packet loss, no prediction is applied on the
 LSP coefficients prior to quantization.
 The LSPs are encoded using vector quantizatin (VQ) with 30 bits for higher
 quality modes and 18 bits for lower quality.

The analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) encoder loop is described in Fig.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Sub-frame-AbS}

\end_inset

.
 There are three main aspects where Speex significantly differs from most
 other CELP codecs.
 First, while most recent CELP codecs make use of fractional pitch estimation
 with a single gain, Speex uses an integer to encode the pitch period, but
 uses a 3-tap predictor (3 gains).
 The adaptive codebook contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{a}[n]$
\end_inset

 can thus be expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
e_{a}[n]=g_{0}e[n-T-1]+g_{1}e[n-T]+g_{2}e[n-T+1]\label{eq:adaptive-3tap}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the jointly quantized pitch gains and 
\begin_inset Formula $e[n]$
\end_inset

 is the codec excitation memory.
 It is worth noting that when the pitch is smaller than the sub-frame size,
 we repeat the excitation at a period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $n-T+1\geq0$
\end_inset

, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $n-2T+1$
\end_inset

 instead.
 In most modes, the pitch period is encoded with 7 bits in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[17,144\right]$
\end_inset

 range and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 coefficients are vector-quantized using 7 bits at higher bit-rates (15
 kbps narrowband and above) and 5 bits at lower bit-rates (11 kbps narrowband
 and below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many current CELP codecs use moving average (MA) prediction to encode the
 fixed codebook gain.
 This provides slightly better coding at the expense of introducing a dependency
 on previously encoded frames.
 A second difference is that Speex encodes the fixed codebook gain as the
 product of the global excitation gain 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{frame}$
\end_inset

 with a sub-frame gain corrections 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{subf}$
\end_inset

.
 This increases robustness to packet loss by eliminating the inter-frame
 dependency.
 The sub-frame gain correction is encoded before the fixed codebook is searched
 (not closed-loop optimized) and uses between 0 and 3 bits per sub-frame,
 depending on the bit-rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third difference is that Speex uses sub-vector quantization of the innovatio
n (fixed codebook) signal instead of an algebraic codebook.
 Each sub-frame is divided into sub-vectors of lengths ranging between 5
 and 20 samples.
 Each sub-vector is chosen from a bitrate-dependent codebook and all sub-vectors
 are concatenated to form a sub-frame.
 As an example, the 3.95 kbps mode uses a sub-vector size of 20 samples with
 32 entries in the codebook (5 bits).
 This means that the innovation is encoded with 10 bits per sub-frame, or
 2000 bps.
 On the other hand, the 18.2 kbps mode uses a sub-vector size of 5 samples
 with 256 entries in the codebook (8 bits), so the innovation uses 64 bits
 per sub-frame, or 12800 bps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bit allocation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 7 different narrowband bit-rates defined for Speex, ranging from
 250 bps to 24.6 kbps, although the modes below 5.9 kbps should not be used
 for speech.
 The bit-allocation for each mode is detailed in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-narrowband}

\end_inset

.
 Each frame starts with the mode ID encoded with 4 bits which allows a range
 from 0 to 15, though only the first 7 values are used (the others are reserved).
 The parameters are listed in the table in the order they are packed in
 the bit-stream.
 All frame-based parameters are packed before sub-frame parameters.
 The parameters for a certain sub-frame are all packed before the following
 sub-frame is packed.
 Note that the

 in the parameter description means that the parameter is an open loop estimatio
n based on the whole frame.

So far, no MOS (Mean Opinion Score

 In order to give an idea of the quality achivable with it, table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:quality_vs_bps}

 presents my own subjective opinion on it.
 It sould be noted that different people will perceive the quality differently
 and that the person that designed the codec often has a bias (one way or
 another) when it comes to subjective evaluation.
 Last thing, it should be noted that for most codecs (including Speex) encoding
 quality sometimes varies depending on the input.
 Note that the complexity is only approximate (within 0.5 mflops and using
 the lowest complexity setting).
 Decoding requires approximately 0.5 mflops
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{complexity}

 in most modes (1 mflops with perceptual enhancement).

This section was only valid for version 1.1.12 and earlier.
 It does not apply to version 1.2-beta1 (and later), for which the new perceptual
 enhancement is not yet documented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part of the codec only applies to the decoder and can even be changed
 without affecting inter-operability.
 For that reason, the implementation provided and described here should
 only be considered as a reference implementation.
 The enhancement system is divided into two parts.
 First, the synthesis filter 
\begin_inset Formula $S(z)=1/A(z)$
\end_inset

 is replaced by an enhanced filter:
\begin_inset Formula \[
S'(z)=\frac{A\left(z/a_{2}\right)A\left(z/a_{3}\right)}{A\left(z\right)A\left(z/a_{1}\right)}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset

 depend on the mode in use and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1-\frac{1-ra_{1}}{1-ra_{2}}\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=.9$
\end_inset

.
 The second part of the enhancement consists of using a comb filter to enhance
 the pitch in the excitation domain.

 (QMF) to split the band in two.
 The 16 kHz signal is thus divided into two 8 kHz signals, one representing
 the low band (0-4 kHz), the other the high band (4-8 kHz).
 The low band is encoded with the narrowband mode described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset

 in such a way that the resulting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

embedded narrowband bit-stream
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can also be decoded with the narrowband decoder.
 Since the low band encoding has already been described, only the high band
 encoding is described in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Linear Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear prediction part used for the high-band is very similar to what
 is done for narrowband.
 The only difference is that we use only 12 bits to encode the high-band
 LSP's using a multi-stage vector quantizer (MSVQ).
 The first level quantizes the 10 coefficients with 6 bits and the error
 is then quantized using 6 bits, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Pitch Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That part is easy: there's no pitch prediction for the high-band.
 There are two reasons for that.
 First, there is usually little harmonic structure in this band (above 4
 kHz).
 Second, it would be very hard to implement since the QMF folds the 4-8
 kHz band into 4-0 kHz (reversing the frequency axis), which means that
 the location of the harmonics is no longer at multiples of the fundamental
 (pitch).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Excitation Quantization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high-band excitation is coded in the same way as for narrowband.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bit allocation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the wideband mode, the entire narrowband frame is packed before the
 high-band is encoded.
 The narrowband part of the bit-stream is as defined in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-narrowband}

\end_inset

.
 The high-band follows, as described in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-wideband}

\end_inset

.
 This also means that a wideband frame may be correctly decoded by a narrowband
 decoder with the only caveat that if more than one frame is packed in the
 same packet, the decoder will need to skip the high-band parts in order
 to sync with the bit-stream.

FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Vorbis is open-source
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{open-source}

\end_inset

 and patent-free
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{patent}

\end_inset

; why do we need Speex?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vorbis is a great project but its goals are not the same as Speex.
 Vorbis is mostly aimed at compressing music and audio in general, while
 Speex targets speech only.
 For that reason Speex can achieve much better results than Vorbis on speech,
 typically 2-4 times higher compression at equal quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Isn't there an open-source implementation of the GSM-FR codec? Why is Speex
 necessary?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, it's not clear whether GSM-FR is covered by a Philips patent
 (see http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html).
 Also, GSM-FR offers mediocre quality at a relatively high bit-rate, while
 Speex can offer equivalent quality at almost half the bit-rate.
 Last but not least, Speex offers a wide range of bit-rates and sampling
 rates, while GSM-FR is limited to 8 kHz speech at 13 kbps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Under what license is Speex released?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph's version of the (revised)
 BSD license (see Appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-License}

\end_inset

).
 This license is one of the most permissive open-source licenses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Am I allowed to use Speex in commercial software?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes.
 As long as you comply with the license.
 This basically means you have to keep the copyright notice and you can't
 use our name to promote your product without authorization.
 For more details, see license in Appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-License}

\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Ogg
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Ogg}

\end_inset

, Speex, Vorbis
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Vorbis}

\end_inset

, what's the difference?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ogg is a container format for holding multimedia data.
 Vorbis is an audio codec that uses Ogg to store its bit-streams as files,
 hence the name Ogg Vorbis.
 Speex also uses the Ogg format to store its bit-streams as files, so technicall
y they would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ogg Speex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 files (I prefer to call them just Speex files).
 One difference with Vorbis however, is that Speex is less tied with Ogg.
 Actually, if you just do Voice over IP (VoIP), you don't need Ogg at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
What's the extension for Speex?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speex files have the .spx extension.
 Note, however that the Speex tools (speexenc, speexdec) do not rely on
 the extension at all, so any extension will work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Can I use Speex for compressing music
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{music}

\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just like Vorbis is not really adapted to speech, Speex is really not adapted
 for music.
 In most cases, you'll be better of with Vorbis when it comes to music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
I converted some MP3s to Speex and the quality is bad.
 What's wrong?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is called transcoding and it will always result in much poorer quality
 than the original MP3.
 Unless you have a really good (size) reason to do so, never transcode speech.
 This is even valid for self transcoding (tandeming), i.e.
 If you decode a Speex file and re-encode it again at the same bit-rate,
 you will lose quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Does Speex run on Windows?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compilation on Windows has been supported since version 0.8.0.
 There are also several front-ends available from the website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Why is encoding so slow compared to decoding?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most kinds of compression, encoding is inherently slower than decoding.
 In the case of Speex, encoding consists of finding, for each vector of
 5 to 10 samples, the entry that matches the best within a codebook consisting
 of 16 to 256 entries.
 On the other hand, at decoding all that needs to be done is look up the
 right entry in the codebook using the encoded index.
 Since a lookup is much faster than a search, the decoder works much faster
 than the encoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Why is Speex so slow on my iPaq (or insert any platform without an FPU)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You probably didn't build Speex with the fixed-point option (--enable-fixed-poin
t).
 Even if you did, not all modes have been ported to use fixed-point arithmetic,
 so the code may be slowed down by a few float operations left (e.g.
 in the wideband mode).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
I'm getting unusual background noise (hiss) when using libspeex in my applicatio
n.
 How do I fix that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the causes could be scaling of the input speech.
 Speex expects signals to have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm2^{15}$
\end_inset

 (signed short) dynamic range.
 If the dynamic range of your signals is too small (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1.0$
\end_inset

), you will suffer important quantization noise.
 A good target is to have a dynamic range around 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm8000$
\end_inset

 which is large enough, but small enough to make sure there's no clipping
 when converting back to signed short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
I get very distorted speech when using libspeex in my application.
 What's wrong?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many possible causes for that.
 One of them is errors in the way the bits are manipulated.
 Another possible cause is the use of the same encoder or decoder state
 for more than one audio stream (channel), which produces strange effects
 with the filter memories.
 If the input speech has an amplitude close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm2^{15}$
\end_inset

, it is possible that at decoding, the amplitude be a bit higher than that,
 causing clipping when saving as 16-bit PCM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
How does Speex compare to other proprietary codecs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's hard to give precise figures since no formal listening tests have been
 performed yet.
 All I can say is that in terms of quality, Speex competes on the same ground
 as other proprietary codecs (not necessarily the best, but not the worst
 either).
 Speex also has many features that are not present in most other codecs.
 These include variable bit-rate (VBR), integration of narrowband and wideband,
 as well as stereo support.
 Of course, another area where Speex is really hard to beat is the quality/price
 ratio.
 Unlike many very expensive codecs, Speex is free and anyone may distribute
 or modify it at will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Can Speex pass DTMF
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{DTMF}

\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess it all depends on the bit-rate used.
 Though no formal testing has yet been performed, I'd say is correctly at
 8 kbps and above.
 Also, make sure you don't use the lowest complexity (see SPEEX_SET_COMPLEXITY
 or --comp option), as it causes significant noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Can Speex pass V.9x modem signals correctly?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I could do that I'd be very rich by now :-) Seriously, that would break
 fundamental laws of information theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
What is your (Jean-Marc) relationship with the University of Sherbrooke
 and how does Speex fit into that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have completed my 
\emph on
Ph.D.

\emph default
 at the University of Sherbrooke in 2005 in mobile robotics.
 Although I did my master with the Sherbrooke speech coding group (in speech
 enhancement, not coding), was no longer associated with them when developing
 Speex.
 It should 
\series bold
not
\series default
 be understood that they or the University of Sherbrooke have anything to
 do with the Speex project.
 Furthermore, Speex does not make use of any code or proprietary technology
 developed in the Sherbrooke speech coding group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
CELP, ACELP
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{ACELP}

\end_inset

, what's the difference?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CELP stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Code Excited Linear Prediction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while ACELP stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Algebraic
\emph default
 Code Excited Linear Prediction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That means ACELP is a CELP technique that uses an algebraic codebook represente
d as a sum of unit pulses, thus making the codebook search much more efficient.
 This technique was invented at the University of Sherbrooke and is now
 one of the most widely used form of CELP.
 Unfortunately, since it is patented, it cannot be used in Speex.

\begin_layout Standard
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
 placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
 of this License.
 The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
 Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

\begin_layout Standard
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
 Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers
 or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
 matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
 subject.
 (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
 Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter
 of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
 legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
 designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
 that the Document is released under this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
 Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
 Document is released under this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
 in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose
 contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic
 text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
 or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
 for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety
 of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
 A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been
 designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
 not Transparent.
 A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
 a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed
 for human modification.
 Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be
 read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
 the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-ge
nerated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
 such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
 License requires to appear in the title page.
 For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page"
 means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
2.
 VERBATIM COPYING
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
 or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,
 and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
 reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever
 to those of this License.
 You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
 further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
 However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
 If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
 the conditions in section 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
 may publicly display copies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
3.
 COPYING IN QUANTITY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
 the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
 Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
 cover.
 Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
 of these copies.
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
 equally prominent and visible.
 You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
 title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
 you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
 actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
 than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
 with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessib
le computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
 Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public
 has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
 protocols.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
 you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
 at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
 or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
 well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
 to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
4.
 MODIFICATIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
 conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
 Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling
 the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification
 of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
 In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A.
 Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
 that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
 if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
 You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher
 of that version gives permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
B.
 List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
 for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with
 at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
 authors, if it has less than five).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C.
 State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
 as the publisher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
D.
 Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
E.
 Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
 the other copyright notices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
F.
 Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
 the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
 License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
G.
 Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
 required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
H.
 Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I.
 Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
 item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
 Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
 If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
 the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
 Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
 in the previous sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
J.
 Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
 access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
 locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
 These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
 four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
 the version it refers to gives permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
K.
 In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
 section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone
 of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
L.
 Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
 text and in their titles.
 Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
 titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
M.
 Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".
 Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
N.
 Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
 title with any Invariant Section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
 that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
 the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
 as invariant.
 To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
 Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
 but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
 statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
 as the authoritative definition of a standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
 of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
 Texts in the Modified Version.
 Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
 added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
 If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously
 added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
 behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
 explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
 permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorseme
nt of any Modified Version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
5.
 COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
 under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
 that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all
 of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections
 of your combined work in its license notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
 identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
 If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
 contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
 of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
 that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
 Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in
 the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History";
 likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
 entitled "Dedications".
 You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
6.
 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
 respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
7.
 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
 independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
 medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
 provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.
 Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not
 apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document,
 on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative
 works of the Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
 of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
 aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
 only the Document within the aggregate.
 Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
8.
 TRANSLATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
 translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
 from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some
 or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
 Invariant Sections.
 You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License.
 In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English
 version of this License, the original English version will prevail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
9.
 TERMINATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License.
 Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
10.
 FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
 Free Documentation License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
 the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
 version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundatio
n.
 If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you
 may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
 Foundation.
