/**
 * @defgroup PJ_POOL_GROUP Memory Pool Management
 * @ingroup PJ
 * @brief
 * Memory pool management provides API to allocate and deallocate memory from
 * memory pool and to manage and establish policy for pool creation and
 * destruction in pool factory.
 *
 * \section PJ_POOL_FACTORY_SEC Pool Factory
 * See: \ref PJ_POOL_FACTORY "Pool Factory"
 *
 * A memory pool must be created through a factory. A factory not only provides
 * generic interface functions to create and release pool, but also provides 
 * strategy to manage the life time of pools. One sample implementation, 
 * \a pj_caching_pool, can be set to keep the pools released by application for
 * future use as long as the total memory is below the limit.
 * 
 * The pool factory interface declared in PJLIB is designed to be extensible.
 * Application can define its own strategy by creating it's own pool factory
 * implementation, and this strategy can be used even by existing library
 * without recompilation.
 *
 *
 * \section PJ_POOL_POLICY_SEC Pool Factory Policy
 * See: \ref PJ_POOL_FACTORY "Pool Factory Policy"
 *
 * A pool factory only defines functions to create and release pool and how
 * to manage pools, but the rest of the functionalities are controlled by
 * policy. A pool policy defines:
 *  - how memory block is allocated and deallocated (the default implementation
 *    allocates and deallocate memory by calling malloc() and free()).
 *  - callback to be called when memory allocation inside a pool fails (the
 *    default implementation will throw PJ_NO_MEMORY_EXCEPTION exception).
 *  - concurrency when creating and releasing pool from/to the factory.
 *
 * A pool factory can be given different policy during creation to make
 * it behave differently. For example, caching pool factory can be configured
 * to allocate and deallocate from a static/contiguous/preallocated memory 
 * instead of using malloc()/free().
 * 
 * What strategy/factory and what policy to use is not defined by PJLIB, but
 * instead is left to application to make use whichever is most efficient for
 * itself.
 *
 *
 * \section PJ_POOL_POOL_SEC The Pool
 * See: \ref PJ_POOL "Pool"
 *
 * The memory pool is an opaque object created by pool factory.
 * Application uses this object to request a memory chunk, by calling
 * #pj_pool_alloc or #pj_pool_calloc. When the application has finished using
 * the pool, it must call #pj_pool_release to free all the chunks previously
 * allocated and release the pool back to the factory.
 *
 * \section PJ_POOL_THREADING_SEC More on Threading Policies:
 * - By design, memory allocation from a pool is not thread safe. We assumed 
 *   that a pool will be owned by an object, and thread safety should be 
 *   handled by that object. Thus these functions are not thread safe: 
 *	- #pj_pool_alloc, 
 *	- #pj_pool_calloc, 
 *	- and other pool statistic functions.
 * - Threading in the pool factory is decided by the policy set for the
 *   factory when it was created.
 *
 * \section PJ_POOL_EXAMPLES_SEC Examples
 *
 * For some sample codes on how to use the pool, please see:
 *  - @ref page_pjlib_pool_test

/**
 * @defgroup PJ_POOL Memory Pool.
 * @ingroup PJ_POOL_GROUP
 * @brief
 * A memory pool is initialized with an initial amount of memory, which is
 * called a block. Pool can be configured to dynamically allocate more memory 
 * blocks when it runs out of memory. Subsequent memory allocations by user 
 * will use up portions of these block. 
 * The pool doesn't keep track of individual memory allocations
 * by user, and the user doesn't have to free these indidual allocations. This
 * makes memory allocation simple and very fast. All the memory allocated from
 * the pool will be destroyed when the pool itself is destroyed.
