 *
 * This file provides abstraction for various event dispatching mechanisms. 
 * The interfaces for event dispatching vary alot, even in a single
 * operating system. The abstraction here hopefully is suitable for most of
 * the event dispatching available.
 *
 * Currently, the I/O Queue supports:
 * - select(), as the common denominator, but the least efficient.
 * - I/O Completion ports in Windows NT/2000/XP, which is the most efficient
 *      way to dispatch events in Windows NT based OSes, and most importantly,
 *      it doesn't have the limit on how many handles to monitor. And it works
 *      with files (not only sockets) as well.
