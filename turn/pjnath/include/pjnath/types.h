/**
 * @mainpage PJNATH - Open Source ICE, STUN, and TURN Library
 *
 * \n
 * This is the documentation of PJNATH, an Open Source library providing
 * NAT traversal helper functionalities by using standard based protocols.
 *
 * \n

 * \section PJNATH_STUN STUN Protocol Library
 *
 * Session Traversal Utilities (STUN, or previously known as Simple 
 * Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address 
 * Translators (NAT)s), is a lightweight protocol that serves as a tool for
 * application protocols in dealing with NAT traversal. It allows a client
 * to determine the IP address and port allocated to them by a NAT and to 
 * keep NAT bindings open.
 * 
 * The PJNATH library provides facilities to support both the core 
 * <B>STUN-bis</B> specification and the <B>TURN</B> usage of STUN, 
 * as well as other STUN usages. Please see #pj_stun_attr_type for 
 * list of STUN attributes supported by this library.
 *
 * 
 * The following are some design principles that have been utilized
 * when implementing the STUN library in PJNATH:
 *
 *  - layered architecture, with \ref PJNATH_STUN_MSG as the lowest
 *    layer and \ref PJNATH_STUN_SESSION as the highest abstraction
 *    layer, to accommodate various usage scenario of the library.
 *
 *  - no transport -- the STUN library is pretty much transport
 *    independent and all sending and receiving functionalities will
 *    have to be implemented by application or higher level
 *    abstraction (such as ICE). This helps facilitating an even
 *    more usage scenarios of the library.
 *
 *  - common functionalities for both STUN client and server
 *    development. All STUN components can be used to develop both
 *    STUN client and STUN server application, and in fact, in ICE,
 *    both STUN client and server functionality exist in a single
 *    ICE session.
 *
 * \n
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_STUN_ARCH STUN Library Organization
 *
 * \image html stun-arch.jpg "STUN Library Architecture"
 *
 * The STUN library is organized as follows:
 *
 *  - for both client and server, the highest abstraction is
 *    \ref PJNATH_STUN_SESSION, which provides management of incoming
 *    and outgoing messages and association of STUN credential to
 *    a STUN session. 
 *
 *  - for client, the next layer below is \ref PJNATH_STUN_TRANSACTION,
 *    which manages retransmissions of STUN request. Server side STUN
 *    transaction is handled in \ref PJNATH_STUN_SESSION layer above.
 *
 *  - \ref PJNATH_STUN_AUTH provides mechanism to verify STUN
 *    credential in incoming STUN messages.
 *
 *  - the lowest layer of the library is \ref PJNATH_STUN_MSG. This layer
 *    provides STUN message representation, validation, parsing, 
 *    encoding MESSAGE-INTEGRITY for outgoing messages, and
 *    debugging (dump to log) of STUN messages.
 *
 * All STUN library components are independent of any transports. 
 * Application gives incoming packet to the STUN components for processing,
 * and it must supply the STUN components with callback to send outgoing 
 * messages.
 * 
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_STUN_USING Using STUN Library
 *
 * [The developers guide documentation can certainly be improved here]
 *
 * For a sample STUN and TURN client, please see <tt>pjstun-client</tt>
 * project under <tt>pjnath/src</tt> directory.
 *
 * For a sample STUN and TURN server, please see <tt>pjstun-srv-test</tt>
 * project under <tt>pjnath/src</tt> directory.

 *
 * \section PJNATH_ICE ICE Implementation
 *
 * Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a standard based 
 * methodology for traversing Network Address Translator (NAT), and
 * is described in 
 * <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-19.txt">
 * <B>draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-19.txt</B></A> draft. The PJNATH ICE
 * implementation is aimed to provide a usable and generic ICE transports
 * for different types of application, including but not limited to
 * the usage of ICE in SIP/SDP offer/answer.
 * 
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_ARCH ICE Library Organization
 * 
 * \image html ice-arch.jpg "ICE Architecture"
 *
 * The ICE library is organized as follows:
 *
 *  - the highest abstraction is ICE media transport, which maintains
 *    ICE stream transport and provides SDP translations to be used
 *    for SIP offer/answer exchanges. ICE media transport is part
 *    of PJMEDIA library.
 *
 *  - higher in the hierarchy is \ref PJNATH_ICE_STREAM_TRANSPORT,
 *    which binds ICE with UDP sockets, and provides STUN binding
 *    and relay/TURN allocation for the sockets. This component can
 *    be directly used by application, although normally application
 *    should use the next higher abstraction since it provides
 *    SDP translations and better integration with other PJ libraries
 *    such as PJSIP and PJMEDIA.
 *
 *  - the lowest layer is \ref PJNATH_ICE_SESSION, which provides 
 *    ICE management and negotiation in a transport-independent way.
 *    This layer contains the state machines to perform ICE
 *    negotiation, and provides the most flexibility to control all
 *    aspects of ICE session. This layer normally is only usable for
 *    ICE implementors.
 *
 * \subsection PJNATH_ICE_USING Using the ICE Library
 *
 * For ICE implementation that has been integrated with socket transport,
 * please see \ref PJNATH_ICE_STREAM_TRANSPORT_USING.
 *
 * For ICE implementation that has not been integrated with socket
 * transport, please see \ref pj_ice_sess_using_sec.
