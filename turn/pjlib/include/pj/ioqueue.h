/**
 * @defgroup PJ_IOQUEUE IOQueue: I/O Event Dispatching with Proactor Pattern
 * @ingroup PJ_IO
 * @{
 *
 * I/O Queue provides API for performing asynchronous I/O operations. It
 * conforms to proactor pattern, which allows application to submit an
 * asynchronous operation and to be notified later when the operation has
 * completed.
 *
 * The I/O Queue can work on both socket and file descriptors. For 
 * asynchronous file operations however, one must make sure that the correct
 * file I/O back-end is used, because not all file I/O back-end can be
 * used with the ioqueue. Please see \ref PJ_FILE_IO for more details.
 *
 * The framework works natively in platforms where asynchronous operation API
 * exists, such as in Windows NT with IoCompletionPort/IOCP. In other 
 * platforms, the I/O queue abstracts the operating system's event poll API
 * to provide semantics similar to IoCompletionPort with minimal penalties
 * (i.e. per ioqueue and per handle mutex protection).
 *
 * The I/O queue provides more than just unified abstraction. It also:
 *  - makes sure that the operation uses the most effective way to utilize
 *    the underlying mechanism, to achieve the maximum theoritical
 *    throughput possible on a given platform.
 *  - choose the most efficient mechanism for event polling on a given
 *    platform.
 *
 * Currently, the I/O Queue is implemented using:
 *  - <tt><b>select()</b></tt>, as the common denominator, but the least 
 *    efficient. Also the number of descriptor is limited to 
 *    \c PJ_IOQUEUE_MAX_HANDLES (which by default is 64).
 *  - <tt><b>/dev/epoll</b></tt> on Linux (user mode and kernel mode), 
 *    a much faster replacement for select() on Linux (and more importantly
 *    doesn't have limitation on number of descriptors).
 *  - <b>I/O Completion ports</b> on Windows NT/2000/XP, which is the most 
 *    efficient way to dispatch events in Windows NT based OSes, and most 
 *    importantly, it doesn't have the limit on how many handles to monitor.
 *    And it works with files (not only sockets) as well.
 *
 *
 * \section pj_ioqueue_concurrency_sec Concurrency Rules
 *
 * The items below describe rules that must be obeyed when using the I/O 
 * queue, with regard to concurrency:
 *  - simultaneous operations (by different threads) to different key is safe.
 *  - simultaneous operations to the same key is also safe, except
 *    <b>unregistration</b>, which is described below.
 *  - <b>care must be taken when unregistering a key</b> from the
 *    ioqueue. Application must take care that when one thread is issuing
 *    an unregistration, other thread is not simultaneously invoking an
 *    operation <b>to the same key</b>.
 *\n
 *    This happens because the ioqueue functions are working with a pointer
 *    to the key, and there is a possible race condition where the pointer
 *    has been rendered invalid by other threads before the ioqueue has a
 *    chance to acquire mutex on it.
 *
 * \section pj_ioqeuue_examples_sec Examples
 *
 * For some examples on how to use the I/O Queue, please see:
 *
 *  - \ref page_pjlib_ioqueue_tcp_test
 *  - \ref page_pjlib_ioqueue_udp_test
 *  - \ref page_pjlib_ioqueue_perf_test

 *                  which operation has been completed when the callback is
 *                  called.
 * @param buffer    The buffer to hold the read data. The caller MUST make sure
 *		    that this buffer remain valid until the framework completes
 *		    reading the handle.
 * @param length    On input, it specifies the size of the buffer. If data is
 *                  available to be read immediately, the function returns
 *                  PJ_SUCCESS and this argument will be filled with the
 *                  amount of data read. If the function is pending, caller
 *                  will be notified about the amount of data read in the
 *                  callback. This parameter can point to local variable in
 *                  caller's stack and doesn't have to remain valid for the
 *                  duration of pending operation.
 * @param flags     Recv flag. If flags has PJ_IOQUEUE_ALWAYS_ASYNC then
 *		    the function will never return PJ_SUCCESS.
 * @param addr      Optional Pointer to buffer to receive the address.
 * @param addrlen   On input, specifies the length of the address buffer.
 *                  On output, it will be filled with the actual length of
 *                  the address. This argument can be NULL if \c addr is not
 *                  specified.
 *
 * @return
 *  - PJ_SUCCESS    If immediate data has been received. In this case, the 
 *		    callback must have been called before this function 
 *		    returns, and no pending operation is scheduled.
 *  - PJ_EPENDING   If the operation has been queued.
 *  - non-zero      The return value indicates the error code.
