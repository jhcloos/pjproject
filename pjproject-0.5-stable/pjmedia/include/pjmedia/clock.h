 * @brief Interface for generating clock.
 * @{
 * 
 * The clock generator provides the application with media timing,
 * and it is used by the @ref PJMEDIA_MASTER_PORT for its sound clock.
 *
 * The clock generator may be configured to run <b>asynchronously</b> 
 * (the default behavior) or <b>synchronously</b>. When it is run 
 * asynchronously, it will call the application's callback every time
 * the clock <b>tick</b> expires. When it is run synchronously, 
 * application must continuously polls the clock generator to synchronize
 * the timing.
