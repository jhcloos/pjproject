/**
 * @defgroup PJ_TIMER Timer Heap Management.
 * @ingroup PJ_MISC
 * @brief
 * The timer scheduling implementation here is based on ACE library's 
 * ACE_Timer_Heap, with only little modification to suit our library's style
 * (I even left most of the comments in the original source).
 *
 * To quote the original quote in ACE_Timer_Heap_T class:
 *
 *      This implementation uses a heap-based callout queue of
 *      absolute times.  Therefore, in the average and worst case,
 *      scheduling, canceling, and expiring timers is O(log N) (where
 *      N is the total number of timers).  In addition, we can also
 *      preallocate as many \a ACE_Timer_Nodes as there are slots in
 *      the heap.  This allows us to completely remove the need for
 *      dynamic memory allocation, which is important for real-time
 *      systems.
 *
 * You can find the fine ACE library at:
 *  http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html
