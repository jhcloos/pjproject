/**
 * Opaque declaration for master port.
 * A master port has two media ports connected to it, i.e. downstream and
 * upstream ports. The media stream flowing to the downstream port is called
 * encoding or send direction, and media stream flowing to the upstream port
 * is called decoding or receive direction.
 *
 * A master port has a "clock" that periodically passes the media frame from 
 * downstream to upstream ports, and vice versa. In each run, it retrieves 
 * media frame from one side with #pjmedia_port_get_frame(), and passes the 
 * media frame to the other side with #pjmedia_port_put_frame(). In each run,
 * this process is done for twice, i.e. one for each direction.
