  @section media_port_intro Concepts
  
  @subsection The Media Port
  A media port (represented with pjmedia_port "class") provides a generic
  and extensible framework for implementing media terminations. A media
  port interface basically has the following properties:
  - media port information (pjmedia_port_info) to describe the
  media port properties (sampling rate, number of channels, etc.),
  - pointer to function to acquire frames from the port (<tt>get_frame()
  </tt> interface), which will be called by #pjmedia_port_get_frame()
  public API, and
  - pointer to function to store frames to the port (<tt>put_frame()</tt>
  interface) which will be called by #pjmedia_port_put_frame() public
  API.
  
  Media ports are passive "objects". Applications (or other PJMEDIA 
  components) must actively calls #pjmedia_port_get_frame() or 
  #pjmedia_port_put_frame() from/to the media port in order to retrieve/
  store media frames.
  
  Some media ports (such as @ref PJMEDIA_CONF and @ref PJMEDIA_RESAMPLE_PORT)
  may be interconnected with each other, while some
  others represent the ultimate source/sink termination for the media. 
  The  #pjmedia_port_connect() and #pjmedia_port_disconnect() are used to
  connect and disconnect media ports respectively. But even when ports
  are connected with each other ports, they still remain passive.


  @subsection port_clock_ex1 Example: Manual Resampling

  For example, suppose application wants to convert the sampling rate
  of one WAV file to another. In this case, application would create and
  arrange media ports connection as follows:

    \image html sample-manual-resampling.jpg

  Application would setup the media ports using the following pseudo-
  code:

  \code
  
      pjmedia_port *player, *resample, *writer;
      pj_status_t status;
  
      // Create the file player port.
      status = pjmedia_wav_player_port_create(pool, 
  					      "Input.WAV",	    // file name
  					      20,		    // ptime.
  					      PJMEDIA_FILE_NO_LOOP, // flags
  					      0,		    // buffer size
  					      NULL,		    // user data.
  					      &player );
      PJ_ASSERT_RETURN(status==PJ_SUCCESS, PJ_SUCCESS);
  
      // Create the resample port with specifying the target sampling rate, 
      // and with the file port as the source. This will effectively
      // connect the resample port with the player port.
      status = pjmedia_resample_port_create( pool, player, 8000, 
  					     0, &resample);
      PJ_ASSERT_RETURN(status==PJ_SUCCESS, PJ_SUCCESS);
  
      // Create the file writer, specifying the resample port's configuration
      // as the WAV parameters.
      status pjmedia_wav_writer_port_create(pool, 
  					    "Output.WAV",  // file name.
  					    resample->info.clock_rate,
  					    resample->info.channel_count,
  					    resample->info.samples_per_frame,
  					    resample->info.bits_per_sample,
  					    0,		// flags
  					    0,		// buffer size
  					    NULL,	// user data.
  					    &writer);
  
  \endcode

  
  After the ports have been set up, application can perform the conversion
  process by running this loop:
 
  \code
  
  	pj_int16_t samplebuf[MAX_FRAME];
  	
  	while (1) {
  	    pjmedia_frame frame;
  	    pj_status_t status;
  
  	    frame.buf = samplebuf;
  	    frame.size = sizeof(samplebuf);
  
  	    // Get the frame from resample port.
  	    status = pjmedia_port_get_frame(resample, &frame);
  	    if (status != PJ_SUCCESS || frame.type == PJMEDIA_FRAME_TYPE_NONE) {
  		// End-of-file, end the conversion.
  		break;
  	    }
  
  	    // Put the frame to write port.
  	    status = pjmedia_port_put_frame(writer, &frame);
  	    if (status != PJ_SUCCESS) {
  		// Error in writing the file.
  		break;
  	    }
  	}
  
  \endcode
 
  For the sake of completeness, after the resampling process is done, 
  application would need to destroy the ports:
  
  \code
	// Note: by default, destroying resample port will destroy the
	//	 the downstream port too.
  	pjmedia_port_destroy(resample);
  	pjmedia_port_destroy(writer);
  \endcode
 
 
  The above steps are okay for our simple purpose of changing file's sampling
  rate. But for other purposes, the process of reading and writing frames
  need to be done in timely manner (for example, sending RTP packets to
  remote stream). And more over, as the application's scope goes bigger,
  the same pattern of manually reading/writing frames comes up more and more often,
  thus perhaps it would be better if PJMEDIA provides mechanism to 
  automate this process.
  
  And indeed PJMEDIA does provide such mechanism, which is described in 
  @ref PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK section.


  @subsection media_port_autom Automating Media Flow

  PJMEDIA provides few mechanisms to make media flows automatically
  among media ports. This concept is described in @ref PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK 
  section.

/**
 @defgroup PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK Clock/Timing
 @ingroup PJMEDIA_PORT_CONCEPT
 @brief Various types of classes that provide timing.
 @{

 The media clock/timing extends the media port concept that is explained 
 in @ref PJMEDIA_PORT_CONCEPT. When clock is present in the ports 
 interconnection, media will flow automatically (and with correct timing too!)
 from one media port to another.
 
 There are few objects in PJMEDIA that are able to provide clock/timing
 to media ports interconnection:

 - @ref PJMED_SND_PORT\n
   The sound device makes a good candidate as the clock source, and
   PJMEDIA @ref PJMED_SND is designed so that it is able to invoke
   operations according to timing driven by the sound hardware clock
   (this may sound complicated, but actually it just means that
   the sound device abstraction provides callbacks to be called when
   it has/wants media frames).\n
   See @ref PJMED_SND_PORT for more details.

 - @ref PJMEDIA_MASTER_PORT\n
   The master port uses @ref PJMEDIA_CLOCK as the clock source. By using
   @ref PJMEDIA_MASTER_PORT, it is possible to interconnect passive
   media ports and let the frames flow automatically in timely manner.\n
   Please see @ref PJMEDIA_MASTER_PORT for more details.
