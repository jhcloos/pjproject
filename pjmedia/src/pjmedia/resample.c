 * 
 * HISTORY
 *
 * The first version of this software was written by Julius O. Smith III
 * <jos@ccrma.stanford.edu> at CCRMA <http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu> in
 * 1981.  It was called SRCONV and was written in SAIL for PDP-10
 * compatible machines.  The algorithm was first published in
 * 
 * Smith, Julius O. and Phil Gossett. ``A Flexible Sampling-Rate
 * Conversion Method,'' Proceedings (2): 19.4.1-19.4.4, IEEE Conference
 * on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, San Diego, March 1984.
 * 
 * An expanded tutorial based on this paper is available at the Digital
 * Audio Resampling Home Page given above.
 * 
 * Circa 1988, the SRCONV program was translated from SAIL to C by
 * Christopher Lee Fraley working with Roger Dannenberg at CMU.
 * 
 * Since then, the C version has been maintained by jos.
 * 
 * Sndlib support was added 6/99 by John Gibson <jgg9c@virginia.edu>.
 * 
 * The resample program is free software distributed in accordance

/* PJMEDIA modification:
 *  - remove resample(), just use SrcUp, SrcUD, and SrcLinear directly.
 *  - move FilterUp() and FilterUD() from filterkit.c
 *  - move stddefs.h and resample.h to this file.
 *  - const correctness.
 *  - fixed SrcLinear() may write pass output buffer.
 *  - assume the same for SrcUp() and SrcUD(), so put the same

/* Description of constants:
 *
 * Npc - is the number of look-up values available for the lowpass filter
 *    between the beginning of its impulse response and the "cutoff time"
 *    of the filter.  The cutoff time is defined as the reciprocal of the
 *    lowpass-filter cut off frequence in Hz.  For example, if the
 *    lowpass filter were a sinc function, Npc would be the index of the
 *    impulse-response lookup-table corresponding to the first zero-
 *    crossing of the sinc function.  (The inverse first zero-crossing
 *    time of a sinc function equals its nominal cutoff frequency in Hz.)
 *    Npc must be a power of 2 due to the details of the current
 *    implementation. The default value of 512 is sufficiently high that
 *    using linear interpolation to fill in between the table entries
 *    gives approximately 16-bit accuracy in filter coefficients.
 *
 * Nhc - is log base 2 of Npc.
 *
 * Na - is the number of bits devoted to linear interpolation of the
 *    filter coefficients.
 *
 * Np - is Na + Nhc, the number of bits to the right of the binary point
 *    in the integer "time" variable. To the left of the point, it indexes
 *    the input array (X), and to the right, it is interpreted as a number
 *    between 0 and 1 sample of the input X.  Np must be less than 16 in
 *    this implementation.
 *
 * Nh - is the number of bits in the filter coefficients. The sum of Nh and
 *    the number of bits in the input data (typically 16) cannot exceed 32.
 *    Thus Nh should be 16.  The largest filter coefficient should nearly
 *    fill 16 bits (32767).
 *
 * Nb - is the number of bits in the input data. The sum of Nb and Nh cannot
 *    exceed 32.
 *
 * Nhxn - is the number of bits to right shift after multiplying each input
 *    sample times a filter coefficient. It can be as great as Nh and as
 *    small as 0. Nhxn = Nh-2 gives 2 guard bits in the multiply-add
 *    accumulation.  If Nhxn=0, the accumulation will soon overflow 32 bits.
 *
 * Nhg - is the number of guard bits in mpy-add accumulation (equal to Nh-Nhxn)
 *
 * NLpScl - is the number of bits allocated to the unity-gain normalization
 *    factor.  The output of the lowpass filter is multiplied by LpScl and
 *    then right-shifted NLpScl bits. To avoid overflow, we must have 
 *    Nb+Nhg+NLpScl < 32.

	/* Okay chaps, here's how we do resampling.
	 *
	 * The original resample algorithm requires xoff samples *before* the
	 * input buffer as history, and another xoff samples *after* the
	 * end of the input buffer as lookahead. Since application can only
	 * supply framesize buffer on each run, PJMEDIA needs to arrange the
	 * buffer to meet these requirements.
	 *
	 * So here comes the trick.
	 *
	 * First of all, because of the history and lookahead requirement, 
	 * resample->buffer need to accomodate framesize+2*xoff samples in its
	 * buffer. This is done when the buffer is created.
	 *
	 * On the first run, the input frame (supplied by application) is
	 * copied to resample->buffer at 2*xoff position. The first 2*xoff
	 * samples are initially zeroed (in the initialization). The resample
	 * algorithm then invoked at resample->buffer+xoff ONLY, thus giving
	 * it one xoff at the beginning as zero, and one xoff at the end
	 * as the end of the original input. The resample algorithm will see
	 * that the first xoff samples in the input as zero.
	 *
	 * So here's the layout of resample->buffer on the first run.
	 *
	 * run 0 
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     | 0000 | 0000 |  frame0...   |
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
         *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
         *
	 * (Note again: resample algorithm is called at resample->buffer+xoff)
	 *
	 * At the end of the run, 2*xoff samples from the end of 
	 * resample->buffer are copied to the beginning of resample->buffer.
	 * The first xoff part of this will be used as history for the next
	 * run, and the second xoff part of this is actually the start of
	 * resampling for the next run.
	 *
	 * And the first run completes, the function returns.
	 *
	 * 
	 * On the next run, the input frame supplied by application is again
	 * copied at 2*xoff position in the resample->buffer, and the 
	 * resample algorithm is again invoked at resample->buffer+xoff 
	 * position. So effectively, the resample algorithm will start its
	 * operation on the last xoff from the previous frame, and gets the
	 * history from the last 2*xoff of the previous frame, and the look-
	 * ahead from the last xoff of current frame.
	 *
	 * So on this run, the buffer layout is:
	 *
	 * run 1
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     | frm0 | frm0 |  frame1...   |
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
         *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
	 *
	 * As you can see from above diagram, the resampling algorithm is
	 * actually called from the last xoff part of previous frame (frm0).
	 *
	 * And so on the process continues for the next frame, and the next,
	 * and the next, ...
