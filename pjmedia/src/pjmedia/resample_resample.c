	/* Okay chaps, here's how we do resampling.
	 *
	 * The original resample algorithm requires xoff samples *before* the
	 * input buffer as history, and another xoff samples *after* the
	 * end of the input buffer as lookahead. Since application can only
	 * supply framesize buffer on each run, PJMEDIA needs to arrange the
	 * buffer to meet these requirements.
	 *
	 * So here comes the trick.
	 *
	 * First of all, because of the history and lookahead requirement, 
	 * resample->buffer need to accomodate framesize+2*xoff samples in its
	 * buffer. This is done when the buffer is created.
	 *
	 * On the first run, the input frame (supplied by application) is
	 * copied to resample->buffer at 2*xoff position. The first 2*xoff
	 * samples are initially zeroed (in the initialization). The resample
	 * algorithm then invoked at resample->buffer+xoff ONLY, thus giving
	 * it one xoff at the beginning as zero, and one xoff at the end
	 * as the end of the original input. The resample algorithm will see
	 * that the first xoff samples in the input as zero.
	 *
	 * So here's the layout of resample->buffer on the first run.
	 *
	 * run 0 
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     | 0000 | 0000 |  frame0...   |
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
         *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
         *
	 * (Note again: resample algorithm is called at resample->buffer+xoff)
	 *
	 * At the end of the run, 2*xoff samples from the end of 
	 * resample->buffer are copied to the beginning of resample->buffer.
	 * The first xoff part of this will be used as history for the next
	 * run, and the second xoff part of this is actually the start of
	 * resampling for the next run.
	 *
	 * And the first run completes, the function returns.
	 *
	 * 
	 * On the next run, the input frame supplied by application is again
	 * copied at 2*xoff position in the resample->buffer, and the 
	 * resample algorithm is again invoked at resample->buffer+xoff 
	 * position. So effectively, the resample algorithm will start its
	 * operation on the last xoff from the previous frame, and gets the
	 * history from the last 2*xoff of the previous frame, and the look-
	 * ahead from the last xoff of current frame.
	 *
	 * So on this run, the buffer layout is:
	 *
	 * run 1
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     | frm0 | frm0 |  frame1...   |
	 *     +------+------+--------------+
	 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
         *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
	 *
	 * As you can see from above diagram, the resampling algorithm is
	 * actually called from the last xoff part of previous frame (frm0).
	 *
	 * And so on the process continues for the next frame, and the next,
	 * and the next, ...
	 *
