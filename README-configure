   Configuring the Build System
   Update: 04 May 2006


  1. Overview
  
  The "configure" script in pjproject root directory is not an autoconf script,
but it's just a custom script to generate "build.mak" for the build system. 
The "build.mak" file declares the following global Makefile variables:

  MACHINE_NAME
    The processor and hardware platform of the target. For each MACHINE_NAME,
    there must be matching "m-*.mak" entry in "build/" subdirectory. For 
    example, when MACHINE_NAME is declared as "i386", then there must be 
    "m-i386.mak" file in "build/" subdirectory.
  
  OS_NAME
    Operating system name, determines which "os-*.mak" in "build/" dir to use.

  HOST_NAME
     Build host name, determines which "host-*.mak" to use.

  CC_NAME
     Compiler name, determines which "cc-*.mak" to use.

  TARGET_NAME
     Determines suffix to be added to output files (for example,
     "libpjsip-i386-linux-gcc.a"). The value normally is equal to
     $(MACHINE_NAME)-$(OS_NAME)-$(CC_NAME), but it can contain any value.
  
  CROSS_COMPILE
     Determine the prefix to be applied when invoking build tools (for
     example, "powerpc-rtems-"). The default is empty.


  At present, the configure script CAN NOT be used for configuring cross
compilation. For cross compiling, you must create the "build.mak" file
manually.


  2. Supported Hosts and Targets

  The number of supported hosts and targets will (hopefully) increase over time.
See "build/" subdirectory for list of supported machines, OSes, hosts, and
compilers.
