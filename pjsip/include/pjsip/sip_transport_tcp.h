/**

 * @param local		Optional local address to bind, or specify the
 *			address to bind the server socket to. Both IP 
 *			interface address and port fields are optional.
 *			If IP interface address is not specified, socket
 *			will be bound to PJ_INADDR_ANY. If port is not
 *			specified, socket will be bound to any port
 *			selected by the operating system.
 * @param async_cnt	Number of simultaneous asynchronous accept()
 *			operations to be supported. It is recommended that
 *			the number here corresponds to the number of
 *			processors in the system (or the number of SIP
 *			worker threads).
 * @param p_factory	Optional pointer to receive the instance of the
