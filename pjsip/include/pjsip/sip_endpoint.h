 * @ingroup PJSIP
 * @brief
 * Representation of SIP node instance.
 *
 * SIP Endpoint instance (pjsip_endpoint) can be viewed as the master/owner of
 * all SIP objects in an application. It performs the following roles:
 *  - it manages the allocation/deallocation of memory pools for all objects.
 *  - it manages listeners and transports, and how they are used by 
 *    transactions.
 *  - it owns transaction hash table.
 *  - it receives incoming messages from transport layer and automatically
 *    dispatches them to the correct transaction (or create a new one).
 *  - it has a single instance of timer management (timer heap).
 *  - it manages modules, which is the primary means of extending the library.
 *  - it provides single polling function for all objects and distributes 
 *    events.
 *  - it provides SIP policy such as which outbound proxy to use for all
 *    outgoing SIP request messages.
 *  - it automatically handles incoming requests which can not be handled by
 *    existing modules (such as when incoming request has unsupported method).
 *  - and so on..
 *
 * Theoritically application can have multiple instances of SIP endpoint, 
 * although it's not clear why application may want to do it.
